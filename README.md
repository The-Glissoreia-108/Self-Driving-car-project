## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- TensorFlow (version >= 2.0)
- OpenCV (version >= 4.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/self-driving-car-project.git
   cd self-driving-car-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset:**
   Download the self-driving car dataset and place it in the `data/` directory. You can find the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

4. **Train the model:**
   Train the self-driving car model using the provided scripts. You can customize the training parameters in the configuration files located in the `config/` directory.

5. **Test the model:**
   After training, test the model using test images or videos to evaluate its performance.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset for training and testing the model.
- `models/`: Contains pre-trained models and checkpoints.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for training and testing.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the self-driving car system.
  - `data_loader.py`: Data loading and preprocessing functions.
  - `model.py`: Definition of the self-driving car model architecture.
  - `train.py`: Training script.
  - `test.py`: Testing script.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions used in the project.
